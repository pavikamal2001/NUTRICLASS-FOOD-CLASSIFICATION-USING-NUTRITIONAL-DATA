# NUTRICLASS-FOOD-CLASSIFICATION-USING-NUTRITIONAL-DATA
NutriClass is a machine learning project that classifies food items into multiple categories using nutritional attributes such as calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar. The project focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training multiple classification models. Different machine learning algorithms are evaluated using standard performance metrics to identify the most effective model. This system can support smart dietary, health monitoring, and food recommendation applications.
